How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Well, diff shows the changes or differences between te two versions of a file. It can also show the line number of the texts.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It makes it easy to track changes made, thus help determine a bug easily and quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually choosing to create a commit is giving me the ultimate control of when to commit which in turn makes it easy for me to remember what is being changed. The only downside I think is that it can be tedious, but it doesn't matter much.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately.
To be able to save changes all at once and note that they are saved or commited at the same time with the same purpose.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log command shows all commited changes with date and time to the files. Git diff command shows the differences between two file versions of history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Well, using version control, I can easily find the version that makes the bug, check what changed using get diff, then make the corrections on the latest file version.

Now that you have your worksace setup, what do you want to try using Git for?
I will use Git for android, web development projects.
